CitationNet visualization documentation
=======================================

This Flask app generates tree structures for citation (and their citations)
and references (and their references) of a
source publication using data from `DimensionsAI <https://app.dimensions.ai>`_ and
displays this tree as a 3D network.

The development is part of the research project `ModelSEN <https://modelsen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de>`_
Socio-epistemic networks: Modelling Historical Knowledge Processes,
part of Department I of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and
funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (Grant No. 01 UG2131).
